# Spatial Analysis of Airbnb and Housing Market Dynamics in the UK  

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of Airbnb listings and the housing market in the UK. The project involves spatial data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling using machine learning (Linear Regression). All work is consolidated in a single Jupyter Notebook for easy reference and reproducibility.  

## Features  
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature engineering, and preparing spatial data.  
- **Data Visualization**: Mapping and graphing insights to explore spatial and market trends.  
- **Machine Learning**: Linear regression to predict housing prices and explore key factors affecting market dynamics.  

## Technologies Used  
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization  
- Geopandas for spatial analysis  
- Scikit-learn for machine learning
